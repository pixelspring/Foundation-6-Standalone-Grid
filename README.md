# Foundation 6 Standalone Grid

A standalone version of the grid from Foundation for sites 6.2
[Test Page](http://pixelspring.github.io/Foundation-6-Standalone-Grid/)

## Usage
Use it as you would use the Sass grid in the full version of Foundation. See the foundation [grid docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html) for full usage details. Both the regular and flexbox versions are available.

## Quickstart
Set `box-sizing: border-box;` and you can use either of the following:

##### (a) Semantic Output:
Use the grid mixins to output your own [semantic definitions](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html#building-semantically)

##### (b) Default Grid
or you can generate the complete grid styles by using the `@include foundation-grid;` or `@include foundation-flex-grid;` mixins.
